function [sum,dif,product,m] = mat(num1,num2)
%Please input 2 numbers.
%When calling need to list all the outputs. mat will take the two inputted
%numbers and find the sum, difference, product, and max of those two
%numbers. 

%will add the two inputs together
sum = num1 + num2;
%will substract the two inputs
dif = num1 - num2;
%will multiply the two inputs
product = num1 * num2;
% will find the max value of the two inputs
m = max(num1,num2);

%Write a function that takes 2 numbers as input and 
% returns values for the sum, difference, product and max of the 
% two numbers as outputs.
